I found out that there is a tutorial called windFlowAroundBuildings. So i decided to use that as a template

I now have a better understanding of snappyHexMesh, but adding layers seems to be troublesome

Next steps are to finish adding prism layers, and set up inlet conditions

Update1: Figured out how to implement a velocity profile, and how to initialize it with potentialFoam. Also realized that its probably better to use the motorBike tutorial as a template, rahter than the windFlowAroundBuildings, because the former is more verbosely commented

Next steps: implement roughness length
